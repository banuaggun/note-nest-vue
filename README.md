# Note Nest Vue

## Project Details

Note Nest Vue is a sleek, customizable note‑taking app built with Vue 3 & Vite.

Crafted with Vue.js, this app is designed to make note‑taking effortless and highly personal. My goal was to build a space where ideas can be captured, organized, and styled to match your vibe. With customizable themes and fonts, your notes don’t just stay functional—they become part of your creative flow.

It’s designed to make capturing ideas effortless while letting you style your workspace to match your vibe.
